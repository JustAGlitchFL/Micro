# Micro
A tiny USB-C microphone for various purposes, inspired by the Teenage Engineering CM-15.

This uses a JLI-2555 electret microphone capsule, a Texas Instruments TL-072 OpAmp, and a Texas Instruments PCM2902 Audio Codec. The output from this is fed to both a USB-C port, for communications with the host device and power, but also a 3.5mm TRS cable, for monitoring with headphones or feeding into a camera.

This project serves as a trial run/practice before I attempt a wireless lavalier mic and on-camera shotgun mic for video production. If I am able to attend Undercity, I will bring my Fuji X-M5 with a video rig made of Highway projects, such as [Glow](https://github.com/JustAGlitchFL/Glow). My next project may be a video grip with a compact tripod and controls.
